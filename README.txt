Arithmetic Language (ARITL)
===========================

    TL;DR: basically a glorified calculator that reads files

    Arithmetic Language or ARITL is a simple esoteric 
    "programming" (use that term loosely) language written 
    in C++. It dosen't do much, just basic arithmetic and
    character display.
